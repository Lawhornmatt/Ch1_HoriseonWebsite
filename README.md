~WELCOME:
This is the README.md for the Challenge ONE "first homework assignment" for the UT Coding Bootcamp.
Given source code was refractored and full functionality restored. 

~STRUCTURE:
The repo on GitHub has directories in the below structure:

/Ch1_HoriseonWebsite
|-README.md (you are here)
|-index.html
assets/
|-css/
images/

~HOW TO:
Load index.html in your browser to view the client's refractored website.
css/ contains 'reset.css' and 'style.css'
'reset.css' resets boundry-box so the website behaves nice on all browsers
'style.css' contains all the styling for index.html
images/ contains all the .png and .jpg files necessary to display the website correctly.

~VISIT LIVE:
You can view the website hosted from GitHub by visiting the url:

https://lawhornmatt.github.io/Ch1_HoriseonWebsite/

~SCREENSHOT:
The assignment README.md in the develop folder mentioned including a screenshot in my README.md but
that seems a bit too much for a classic readme. I am unsure what is being asked...
